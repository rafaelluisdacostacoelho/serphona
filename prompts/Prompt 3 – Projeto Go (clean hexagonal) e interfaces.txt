Act as a senior Go engineer using clean/hexagonal architecture to implement the “Serphona Payments Service”.

Based on the previously defined architecture and domain model, I need a concrete Go project layout and key interfaces.

Requirements:
- Go modules, version Go 1.22+.
- Separation of:
  - domain (entities, value objects, domain services)
  - application/use cases (or service layer)
  - adapters (HTTP handlers, Stripe adapter, message broker adapter, DB adapters)
  - infrastructure (PostgreSQL, config, logging, migrations).
- Plug-and-play payment providers (Stripe first, others later) via interfaces.
- Plug-and-play message brokers via interfaces.
- HTTP API using a popular router (chi/gin/echo, you can choose one and justify).

Please:

1. Propose a concrete Go folder structure:
   - show a tree-like layout (e.g., /cmd, /internal, /pkg, etc.).
   - explicitly list main packages (e.g., internal/domain/subscriptions, internal/app/wallet, internal/adapters/http, internal/adapters/stripe, internal/adapters/broker, internal/infra/db, etc.).

2. Define key Go interfaces:
   - PaymentProvider (for Stripe and others)
   - SubscriptionRepository
   - WalletRepository
   - TenantRepository
   - EventPublisher (for sending events to a broker)
   - WebhookEventStore / AuditLogRepository

3. Provide example Go interfaces and structs:
   - PaymentProvider interface with methods for creating customers, creating subscriptions, canceling subscriptions, creating payment intents, handling refunds.
   - WalletService or WalletUseCase with methods like:
     - TopUpWallet
     - ReserveCredits
     - ConsumeCredits
     - ReleaseReservation (if using reservations).

4. Suggest patterns for:
   - dependency injection / wiring in main.go
   - configuration (env-based with defaults)
   - logging (structured logging)
   - error handling (wrapping, classification, mapping to HTTP errors).

5. Output a detailed explanation plus code snippets of key interfaces and a simplified main.go wiring sketch.
