Act as a senior DevOps / SRE engineer.

I want to deploy the “Serphona Payments Service” written in Go using Docker and Kubernetes, with production-ready concerns.

Requirements:
- Containerized Go service.
- Stateless app containers (state in PostgreSQL, Redis if needed, and message broker).
- Environment-specific configuration (dev, staging, prod).
- Basic observability:
  - structured logs
  - metrics (Prometheus)
  - health checks
  - readiness/liveness probes.

Please:

1. Propose a Dockerfile for the Go service:
   - multi-stage build
   - small final image
   - non-root user.

2. Propose basic Kubernetes manifests:
   - Deployment
   - Service (ClusterIP)
   - ConfigMap/Secret examples (for Stripe keys, DB credentials, etc.)
   - HorizontalPodAutoscaler suggestion.

3. Suggest:
   - readiness and liveness probes (HTTP endpoints and configuration).
   - logging approach compatible with centralized log aggregation.
   - metrics endpoints (Prometheus) and example metrics to expose.

4. Explain how to handle:
   - migrations (e.g., using a Job or initContainer)
   - environment-specific values (Helm or Kustomize).

5. Provide example YAML snippets for:
   - Deployment with env vars for STRIPE_API_KEY, DB_CONN_STRING, etc.
   - Service and probes.
