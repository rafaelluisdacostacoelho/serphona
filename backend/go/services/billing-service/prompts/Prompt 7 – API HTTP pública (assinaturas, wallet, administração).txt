You are an experienced API designer.

I need to define the public HTTP API for the “Serphona Payments Service”, which will be consumed by:

- my own platform backend (to manage tenants, users, subscriptions, wallet, etc.)
- admin panel
- possibly some internal tools.

Please:

1. Design REST-style endpoints for:
   - Tenant → create, link to Stripe customer, retrieve details
   - Subscriptions → list plans, create subscription, cancel subscription, change plan, get subscription status
   - Wallet → get balance, top-up (initiate top-up flow via Stripe), consume credits, list transactions
   - Webhooks → endpoint for Stripe webhooks
   - Admin → manual wallet adjustment, force-sync subscription with Stripe, reprocess failed webhooks.

2. For each endpoint:
   - propose HTTP method, path, request body, response body, and typical HTTP status codes.
   - include idempotency recommendations for critical endpoints (e.g. an Idempotency-Key header).

3. Suggest a consistent error format:
   - error code, message, details, correlation_id.

4. Explain how to authenticate and authorize calls to this API:
   - internal services (e.g. via service tokens, mTLS, or JWT)
   - admin panel.

5. Return the answer as:
   - Part A: endpoint summary table
   - Part B: detailed specification of a few critical endpoints (e.g. create subscription, consume credits).
